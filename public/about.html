<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a third-year Computer Science and Engineering student at Netaji Subhas University of Technology, with a strong foundation in programming, data structures, and algorithms. Passionate about problem-solving and mathematics, I enjoy applying my skills through hands-on projects such as web development and game design, and I'm currently exploring areas like machine learning and systems programming. With experience in languages like C++, Python, and JavaScript, I thrive in team-oriented environments that foster learning by doing. I'm also an active volunteer with the National Service Scheme, driven by curiosity and a constant desire to learn and grow.</p>
